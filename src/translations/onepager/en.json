      {
        "question": "What is Bufo Alvarius / 5-MeO-DMT?",
        "answer": "Bufo Alvarius is 5-MeO-DMT extracted from the Sonoran Desert Toad. It is the most potent entheogenic compound on Earth, capable of inducing complete ego dissolution and non-dual consciousness within seconds. This is not a psychedelic in the traditional sense—it's a sacred teacher of death and pure remembrance. The experience is brief (15-30 minutes) but profoundly transformative."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Bufo safe?",
        "answer": "When held in proper ceremony by trained facilitators with thorough medical screening, Bufo is physiologically safe for most people. However, it is psychologically and spiritually intense. Safety requires: (1) Medical screening to rule out contraindications, (2) Trauma-informed facilitation, (3) Integration support. This is why ceremony is only offered after discernment—never sold directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the contraindications?",
        "answer": "Bufo is contraindicated for those with: heart conditions, high blood pressure, psychosis or schizophrenia, epilepsy, pregnancy/breastfeeding, active use of SSRIs or MAOIs, recent surgery, severe unprocessed trauma without therapeutic support, and active substance abuse. This is why medical screening is mandatory."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need preparation sessions?",
        "answer": "Preparation sessions are optional but highly recommended, especially for first-time participants. They help anchor your nervous system, assess emotional readiness, and create a sacred container for the experience. However, medical screening and mutual discernment are required for everyone."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is integration included?",
        "answer": "Yes! One integration session within 48 hours is included with every ceremony. Additional integration sessions are available for those who want deeper support anchoring the insights into daily life."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if this is right for me?",
        "answer": "You'll know. If you've read this far and something inside you says 'yes'—that's your signal. If you're curious but terrified, that's normal. If you're seeking a quick fix or peak experience, this isn't for you. If you're ready to surrender everything, to face truth without bypassing—then reach out. The discernment process will clarify readiness for both of us."
