# Visual Storytelling & Content Enhancement Prompt

## Context
This is the Spirit Awakening Medicine website - a sacred space for Bufo Alvarius (5-MeO-DMT) ceremonies facilitated by Nina & Astral in Mazunte, Mexico. The site currently has good functionality and structure, but we want to enhance it with:

1. **More visual storytelling elements** - photos in different formats/layouts
2. **Less "sales-y" content** - more authentic, story-driven copy
3. **Maintain strong boundaries** - Keep the "this is your own responsibility" warnings and ethical framework

---

## Source Material for Authentic Voice & Content

### **IMPORTANT: Use These as Reference**

You have access to Astral's existing content that contains the authentic spiritual foundation and voice:

1. **Student Manual** - Look for files like:
   - Any PDFs or markdown files with preparation/integration guidance
   - Ceremony protocols and sacred practices
   - Philosophical/spiritual framework
   - Check the project root and `/spirit/` folder for documents

2. **Astral's Content** - The spiritual and practical foundation:
   - Use the tone, language, and concepts from existing materials
   - Reference specific practices, teachings, or frameworks mentioned
   - Maintain consistency with their established voice and approach

3. **How to Use This Material:**
   - ✅ Pull actual quotes or concepts from the manual
   - ✅ Use their specific language for spiritual concepts
   - ✅ Reference their preparation/integration frameworks
   - ✅ Maintain their authentic teaching voice
   - ✅ Weave their wisdom into the website content
   - ❌ Don't contradict or water down their teachings
   - ❌ Don't add generic spirituality that isn't their voice

**SEARCH THE PROJECT:** Look for `.pdf`, `.md`, `.docx` files that contain preparation guides, ceremony protocols, integration materials, or teaching content. Use these as your north star for tone and substance.

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working Well (KEEP THIS):
- **Strong ethical boundaries** - Clear contraindications, screening process, "not for everyone" messaging
- **Professional structure** - Clean navigation, clear ceremony details
- **Sacred tone** - Respectful of the medicine and indigenous lineage
- **Real images** - We have Nina & Astral portraits and ceremony space photos
- **Translation system** - Full EN/ES/FR support

### 🎨 What Needs Enhancement:
- **Visual variety** - More photos in different layouts (grids, galleries, embedded in text)
- **Storytelling voice** - Less promotional, more experiential and authentic
- **Journey narrative** - Help visitors feel the transformation arc: Preparation → Ceremony → Integration
- **Humanize facilitators** - Show more of Nina & Astral's story, not just credentials

## Task: Visual & Content Enhancement

### Phase 1: Add More Visual Elements

#### 1.1 Image Galleries
- [ ] **About Page** - Add a photo gallery showing:
  - Nina & Astral in ceremony space
  - Preparation/integration circles
  - Sacred objects, altar setups
  - Mazunte location beauty
  - Use a grid layout (2-3 columns) with ceremony images

- [ ] **Ceremonies Page** - Add visual journey:
  - Before/during/after visual narrative
  - Small image inserts within text sections
  - Quote overlays on atmospheric images

- [ ] **Preparation Page** - Add:
  - Small images of meditation/breathwork/journaling
  - Visual examples of preparation practices
  - Consider a horizontal scrolling gallery

- [ ] **Integration Page** - Add:
  - Integration circle photos
  - Nature reflection imagery
  - Community gathering visuals

#### 1.2 Different Image Formats to Try:
- **Circular cropped images** - For testimonials or team
- **Side-by-side comparisons** - Sacred space day/night
- **Text-wrapped images** - Small images inline with paragraphs
- **Full-width with quote overlays** - Already doing this, do more!
- **Grid galleries** - 2x2 or 3x3 ceremony/location images
- **Image + caption cards** - Styled cards with images and descriptive text

#### 1.3 Specific Placements:
```
About Page:
- Add 2-3 small ceremony images in "Training & Approach" section
- Add gallery after "Why I Do This Work" (4-6 images showing ceremony/integration)

Ceremonies Page:
- Add small image of altar/sacred objects in "What is Bufo Alvarius" section
- Add 2-image comparison (ceremony space + integration circle) after "Ceremony Details"

Preparation Page:
- Add 3 small images showing different preparation practices
- Consider image carousel/slideshow

Integration Page:
- Add integration circle photos in grid format
- Small nature reflection images inline with text

Retreats Page:
- Already has good image placement, but could add more atmosphere images
- Consider adding a gallery at the bottom showing retreat experience

Testimonials Page:
- Currently has client portrait placeholders - keep those optional
- Could add small ceremony space images between testimonial groups
```

### Phase 2: Content Transformation - Less Sales, More Story

#### 2.1 General Principles:
✅ **DO:**
- Write in first person (we/I) when authentic
- Share personal experiences and observations
- Use specific, sensory details
- Show the journey, not just the destination
- Acknowledge complexity and difficulty
- Honor the medicine and lineage

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use marketing language ("transform your life", "breakthrough", "unlock")
- Make promises or guarantees
- Pressure people to apply
- Oversell the experience
- Remove safety warnings or contraindications

#### 2.2 Sections to Rewrite (Examples):

**BEFORE (Sales-y):**
> "Our ceremonies offer a profound opportunity to transform your life and breakthrough limiting patterns."

**AFTER (Storytelling):**
> "In the quiet of the Mazunte jungle, something shifts. Not always what you expect. Not always comfortable. But often, deeply true."

---

**BEFORE (Sales-y):**
> "Apply now to secure your spot in our next retreat!"

**AFTER (Storytelling):**
> "If this feels like your path, reach out. We'll talk. Sometimes it's a yes, sometimes it's not yet, sometimes it's a gentle no."

---

**BEFORE (Promotional):**
> "I'm a certified facilitator with extensive training in..."

**AFTER (Human):**
> "I didn't come to this work by accident. My own journey with plant medicine cracked me open, showed me edges I didn't know I had. Now I sit with others in that same sacred terror and beauty."

#### 2.3 Specific Pages to Transform:

**Homepage:**
- Current hero is okay, but could be more inviting/less formal
- "Who This Is For" section could be more story-driven
- Add a "Why We Do This" narrative section (personal story from Nina/Astral)

**About Page:**
- Expand "My Personal Journey with Medicine" - make it more vulnerable and specific
- "Training & Approach" is too resume-like - weave credentials into story
- Add a section: "What We've Learned" or "What This Work Has Taught Us"

**Ceremonies Page:**
- Good structure, but could add more experiential language
- Add a "What to Expect" section with honest, detailed descriptions
- Include a "Common Questions" with real, unfiltered answers

**Preparation Page:**
- Add stories of how preparation helped specific people (anonymized)
- Make it less checklist, more invitation

**Integration Page:**
- Add stories of integration journeys (what worked, what didn't)
- Acknowledge that integration is often harder than the ceremony

**Testimonials Page:**
- Good as is, but could add intro: "In their own words..."
- Maybe add a note about editing for privacy/brevity

---

### Phase 3: Maintain Sacred Boundaries

#### CRITICAL: Do NOT Remove or Soften:
- ✅ Contraindications list
- ✅ "Not for everyone" messaging
- ✅ Medical/psychological screening requirements
- ✅ Seri lineage attribution
- ✅ Informed consent language
- ✅ "This is serious medicine" warnings
- ✅ Legal disclaimers

#### KEEP the "This is your responsibility" vibe:
The site should feel like:
- "We're here to hold space, but this is YOUR journey"
- "We won't save you, we'll witness you"
- "This requires your full participation"
- "We screen carefully - not everyone is ready"

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Image Implementation:
```tsx
// Grid Gallery Example
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <img src="/images/atmosphere/ceremony-04.jpg" className="w-full aspect-square object-cover rounded-lg" />
  <img src="/images/atmosphere/ceremony-05.jpg" className="w-full aspect-square object-cover rounded-lg" />
  {/* ... */}
</div>

// Inline Image with Text
<div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 items-center">
  <div>
    <p>Your text content here...</p>
  </div>
  <img src="/images/atmosphere/ceremony-11.jpeg" className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
</div>

// Circular Images
<img src="/images/portraits/nina-portrait.jpg" className="w-32 h-32 rounded-full object-cover mx-auto" />
```

### Content Implementation:
- Edit the translation JSON files: `src/translations/pages/[page]/en.json` (and es.json, fr.json)
- Keep the structure, just rewrite the text content
- Maintain all existing keys/structure for translations

---

## Success Criteria

When you're done, the website should feel:
- ✅ **Visually rich** - Images woven throughout, not just hero shots
- ✅ **Story-driven** - Reads like a personal invitation, not a sales page
- ✅ **Grounded** - Honest about difficulty, complexity, responsibility
- ✅ **Sacred** - Respects the medicine, lineage, and participants
- ✅ **Human** - Shows Nina & Astral as real people, not just credentials
- ✅ **Boundaried** - Clear about who this is/isn't for

It should NOT feel:
- ❌ Sales-y or pushy
- ❌ Making promises it can't keep
- ❌ Like a resort or spa
- ❌ Overly mystical or "woo"
- ❌ Corporate or sterile

---

## Suggested Workflow

1. **FIRST: Find and read source materials** (30 minutes)
   - Search project for student manual, PDFs, preparation guides
   - Read Astral's existing content to understand voice/teachings
   - Take notes on key concepts, practices, language patterns
   - Identify quotes or frameworks to incorporate

2. **Then visual additions** (Phase 1)
   - Add image galleries to About page first
   - Test different layouts (grid, inline, carousel)
   - Use the 12 unused ceremony images

3. **Then content transformation** (Phase 2)
   - Begin with Homepage hero/intro
   - Move to About page personal story
   - Rewrite section by section **using source material as guide**
   - Pull in actual teachings/practices from the manual
   - Use Astral's authentic language and concepts

4. **Review boundaries** (Phase 3)
   - Double-check all warnings intact
   - Ensure screening process clear
   - Keep ethical framework strong

## Notes & Guidance

- **Tone reference:** Authentic, grounded, vulnerable, honest, sacred
- **NOT like:** Retreat centers, wellness spas, self-help gurus
- **More like:** A friend who's been there, inviting you to something real
- **Remember:** This is serious medicine work, not a vacation
- **Honor:** The Seri people, the Sonoran Desert toad, the participants' journeys

---

## Questions to Consider While Working:

1. Does this image/text make the work feel more accessible or more sacred? (Both is good)
2. Am I making promises the medicine can't keep?
3. Would someone with trauma feel safe reading this?
4. Does this honor the indigenous lineage?
5. Am I showing the beauty AND the difficulty?
6. Would I want to work with these facilitators based on this content?

**Good luck! You're helping create a space that honors both the medicine and the people who seek it.** 🌿🔥✨
