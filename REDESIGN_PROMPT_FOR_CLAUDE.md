## üìù CONTENT GUIDELINES

### **Key Messaging:**

**Primary Headline Concepts:**

2. "Die Before You Die"
3. "The Most Potent Entheogenic Compound on Earth"
4. "Ego Dissolution & Non-Dual Consciousness"
5. "Sacred Medicine of the Sonoran Desert"

**Core Positioning:**
- This is NOT promoted publicly - only for those who feel the call
- Application-based, discernment process
- Trauma-informed approach
- Seri Tribe lineage

**Example Copy from Source:**

> "This is not an offering I promote publicly. If you are here, you've been guided, invited, or felt the call. The toad (Bufo Alvarius / 5-MeO-DMT) is not a psychedelic. It is a sacred teacher of death and pure remembrance. It is not for everyone, and it is not a shortcut. This path requires humility, surrender, and integration."

> "I have sat with the medicine. I have died, dissolved, returned, and broken again. I hold this work with reverence. If you feel called, let's walk slowly. This is sacred territory‚Äînot a service. Trust yourself."

### **Who This Is For:**

‚úÖ Include:
- Those ready to die before they die
- Those who've done deep inner work
