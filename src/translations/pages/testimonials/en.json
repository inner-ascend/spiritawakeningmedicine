Their compassion and belief allows vulnerability in the unknown, acceptance of ugly realities and enables you to rise above blocks we accumulate along with our lives. They showed me how to love myself, that experience is strength, and our power runs further than this body.",

They take you straight into the subconscious mind so together you find the cause of your limiting beliefs and clear them.
