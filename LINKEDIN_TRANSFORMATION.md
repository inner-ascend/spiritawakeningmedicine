# LinkedIn Profile Transformation Guide

**For:** Jordi Amat
**Purpose:** Transform your LinkedIn from "tech professional with spiritual side interest" to "rare intersection of senior engineering + sacred medicine facilitation"
**Date:** November 2025

---

## 🎯 The Core Problem

Your current LinkedIn profile positions you as a **Product & Engineering Lead** with a brief mention of spiritual coaching. But this completely undersells your unique value:

- **10+ years** as Bufo Alvarius Facilitator
- **500+ ceremonies** held
- **1,000+ souls** witnessed
- **500+ hours** of conscious leadership training
- **4 active platforms** at the intersection of tech and healing
- **Rare combination** of CTO-level technical expertise + deep healing wisdom

**You're not just a tech leader who meditates. You're one of the only senior engineers in the world with 500+ sacred medicine ceremonies under your belt.**

---

## 🌟 Your Unique Value Proposition

### The Rare Intersection

**Most engineers** don't have 500 hours of facilitation training.
**Most healers** don't have 10 years of technical leadership experience.
**Most Bufo facilitators** don't build mobile apps for integration.
**Most CTOs** haven't facilitated 500+ medicine ceremonies.

### What This Means for Different Audiences

**For Tech Recruiters:**
- Compassionate, trauma-informed leadership
- Human-centered design from lived experience
- Systems thinking enhanced by somatic awareness
- Proven ability to build wellness technology that actually works (65% completion rate vs 15% industry average)
- Team management informed by facilitation training

**For Healing Community:**
- Engineering precision applied to ceremony safety protocols
- Product thinking creates scalable healing containers
- Technical infrastructure for community platforms
- Data-informed iteration while maintaining human-centered care
- Bridges ancient wisdom with emerging technology (Web3, mobile apps, DAO governance)

---

## 📝 Recommended Profile Changes

### 1. HEADLINE

**Current:**
```
Product & Engineering Lead | Full-Stack | Remote | UK-Based (Settled) | React · React Native · TypeScript · .NET
```

**RECOMMENDED (Option D - Accessible):**
```
Product & Engineering Lead | Sacred Medicine Facilitator | Building Wellness Tech & Conscious Communities | React · Node · AWS
```

**Why Option D:**
- Leads with familiar tech title (Product & Engineering Lead) that recruiters recognize
- Clearly states both worlds (Sacred Medicine Facilitator)
- Shows the bridge (Building Wellness Tech & Conscious Communities)
- Includes tech keywords for recruiter searches (React, Node, AWS)
- Professional but authentic - doesn't hide your healing work, doesn't lead with controversy
- Accessible to both tech recruiters and conscious business leaders

---

### 2. ABOUT SECTION

**Current Version Issues:**
- Buries spiritual work in the middle
- Describes it generically ("Spiritual Coach and Earth Medicine Facilitator")
- Doesn't quantify the depth of experience
- Doesn't show how the two worlds synergize

**New Version:**

```
I bridge two worlds that rarely meet: senior software engineering and sacred medicine facilitation.

For 10+ years, I've built scalable platforms serving 10,000+ users across wellness, community, and DAO governance.
For 10+ years, I've held space for 1,000+ souls in Bufo Alvarius ceremonies and integration journeys.

Both paths teach the same truth—transformation requires solid foundations, trauma-informed care, and integration.

THE JOURNEY

My awakening began with a breakdown that became a breakthrough. Rock bottom became my foundation.
I completed 500+ hours of facilitation training across multiple modalities:
• Bufo Alvarius Sacred Medicine (10+ years, 500+ ceremonies)
• Family Constellations & Systemic Healing
• Somatic Therapy & Trauma-Informed Bodywork
• Theta Healing, Reiki, Energy Work
• Conscious Leadership & Art of Hosting

During a 2-year sabbatical (2021-2022), I deepened my practice while continuing to prototype wellness technology.
I didn't leave tech behind—I brought consciousness into code.

THE SYNERGY

My engineering background enhances my healing work:
• Product thinking → Sacred container design with iterative refinement
• Safety protocols → Rigorous medical screening and risk mitigation
• Full-stack mindset → Holistic systems view (body, mind, spirit, relationships, purpose)
• Data-informed decisions → 500+ ceremonies worth of lived experience

My healing training transforms my technical leadership:
• Compassionate team management informed by facilitation skills
• Human-centered design from deep somatic awareness
• Trauma-informed approach to change management and feedback
• Authentic communication practices (NVC, Art of Hosting)
