    "title": "The Call",
    "p1": "We didn't find the medicine. It found us.",
    "p2": "For years, we walked the seeker's path. Meditation retreats. Therapy. Energy work. Self-development courses. We thought we were healing. We thought we were growing.",
    "p3": "And then the medicine showed us we were still performing.",
    "quote1": "The first time we sat with Bufo, we died.",
    "p4": "Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. We died.",
    "p5": "Everything we thought we were—our names, our stories, our achievements, our wounds, our identities—dissolved. Gone. Within seconds.",
    "p6": "What remained was pure awareness. No separation. No \"me\" and \"other.\" Just... everything. And nothing.",
    "p7": "We returned to our bodies different people. Or more accurately: we returned knowing there is no person. Only presence wearing temporary names."

    "p1": "This medicine doesn't belong to us. It belongs to the indigenous people who have held it sacred for generations. The Seri Tribe of the Sonoran Desert—the original guardians of Bufo Alvarius.",
    "p2": "Our initiation wasn't a weekend workshop. It wasn't a certification. It was years of apprenticeship, ceremony, humility, and dying again and again until we learned how to truly hold space for death.",
    "p3": "We were taught by elders who understand that this medicine is not a tool—it's a teacher. And the facilitator is not a guide—they're a servant.",
    "p4": "We hold this work with reverence because we know its power. We've sat with the medicine hundreds of times. We've died, dissolved, returned, and broken again. We've witnessed others cross the threshold and come back transformed—or traumatized when the container wasn't held properly.",
    "p5": "This is why we demand preparation. Why we screen for contraindications. Why we refuse to work with people who aren't ready.",
    "p5Strong": "This isn't about money or ego—it's about protecting the sacred nature of the work."

    "p1": "We are not above the medicine.",
    "p1Strong": " We are students of it.",
    "p2": "We've sat with Bufo more times than we can count. Some journeys were transcendent—pure bliss, cosmic love, remembrance. Others were terrifying—confronting the void, facing the illusion of separation, experiencing total annihilation.",
    "p3": "We've also worked with Ayahuasca, psilocybin, San Pedro, and other plant teachers. Each has shown us different facets of truth. But Bufo is unique—it doesn't show you anything. It dissolves you completely. There's nowhere to hide.",
    "quote": "We have sat with the medicine. We have died, dissolved, returned, and broken again.",
    "p4": "This isn't romantic. It's not spiritual bypassing. It's the hard-earned wisdom of people who've walked through the fire and come back—again and again—until we learned how to hold others through their own passage.",
    "p5": "We don't facilitate because we've \"mastered\" anything. We facilitate because we've been humbled enough by the medicine to know our place: servants, not saviors."

  "why": {
    "title": "Why We Hold This Work",
    "p1": "Because the medicine saved our lives.",
    "p2": "Not by fixing us. Not by making our problems disappear. But by showing us that the \"I\" was the problem. The story, the identity, the constant seeking—all of it was a defense against the simplicity of just... being.",
    "p3": "We facilitate Bufo ceremonies because we know what it's like to be lost in spiritual concepts and hungry for truth. We know what it's like to seek and seek and never arrive. And we know what it's like to finally stop—to dissolve into the void and discover that the void is fullness.",
    "quote": "This work is our prayer. Our service. Our way of honoring the gift we were given when we died before we died.",
